## Digital humanities: a multidisciplinary intersection

As a 19-year-old sophomore at NYU Abu Dhabi, I embarked on a transformative journey by enrolling in an introductory course in digital humanities. What made this experience particularly enriching was the diverse group of classmates who joined me. Our majors spanned a wide spectrum of disciplines, including Computer Science, Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing. Together, we have explored digital literacy, each bringing a unique set of strategies and skills into the classroom.

### _The Tools_
Before immersing ourselves in the world of digital humanities, as avid social media user and technology enjoyers, we had already developed our own strategies for navigating the digital landscape in both daily life and academics. As a Computer Science major, I was well-versed in coding languages such as Python, Javascript, C++ and HTML, using them for software development, web-design and . My academic journey was marked by problem-solving, algorithm design, and collaborative coding through platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/).

My peers from Interactive Media, Film and New Media, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing had their own digital toolkits. Interactive Media students excelled in user-centered design and interactive storytelling, often utilizing software like Adobe Creative Suite. Film and New Media enthusiasts delved into multimedia production and digital narrative creation. Environmental Studies majors leveraged data analysis software for environmental research, while Business and Marketing students honed their skills in data analytics platforms for market analysis. Students in Literature and Creative Writing dived deep into research databases to fuel their literary and artistic pursuits.

However, this digital humanities course has illuminated the intersection of our diverse disciplines in the digital age. Content creation, once thought to be confined to specific fields, took on a multidisciplinary dimension. We explored creating interactive websites, digital art installations, immersive narratives, and AI-generated content. Our collaborative efforts showcased the power of interdisciplinary collaboration, blurring the lines between art, science, and storytelling.

### _Flow and Control of Data_
Social interaction and collaboration also evolved. Platforms like [Slack](slack.com), [Discord](discord.com), and [online forums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum) became hubs for exchanging ideas, sparking discussions, and collaborating on projects. We found ourselves engaging in thought-provoking conversations that spanned our areas of expertise, enriching our perspectives and generating innovative ideas. Collaborating across disciplines proved to be a catalyst for creativity and interdisciplinary thinking.

Research data management and manipulation emerged as a common thread that united us all. We delved into text analysis, data visualization, and digital archives. Tools like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Omeka](https://omeka.org/) became invaluable for organizing, annotating, and sharing research materials. The importance of data literacy transcended individual majors, equipping us to navigate the data-driven landscape of the digital age.

Our critical reflection on our current abilities led us to appreciate the concept of "[computational thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_thinking)‚Äù in the age of AI. We understood that skills in data analysis, algorithm understanding, and result interpretation were universally valuable, regardless of our major. As AI continues to shape our world, these skills will empower us to harness its potential for innovation and informed decision-making.

### _Learnings_

Digital humanities has broadened our horizons, offering fresh perspectives on our respective fields of study. We began to contemplate the [ethical implications of AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence) and data usage within our disciplines. Computer Science majors questioned the ethical responsibilities of AI developers, while Literature and Creative Writing students considered the impact of AI-generated content on storytelling. Interactive Media students explored the possibilities of AI-generated art, and Business and Marketing students delved into AI-driven market analysis.

### _Objectives and Goals_

Looking ahead, I am excited to continue our exploration of new ways of thinking and working. We aim to cultivate a holistic approach to education that recognizes the value of interdisciplinary thinking in a digitally driven world. I envision a future where collaboration between the world of science, arts and humanities becomes the norm, fostering innovation and pushing the boundaries of our fields. 

### _Conclusion_

In conclusion, our journey through digital humanities has been transformative. It has expanded our horizons, bridged the gap between technology and the humanities, and equipped us with a multifaceted understanding of digital literacy. As we continue to navigate the digital landscape, we are poised to embrace new ways of thinking and working that promote interdisciplinary collaboration and responsible digital citizenship. In the age of AI, we are ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
